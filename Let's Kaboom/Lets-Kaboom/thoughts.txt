So far the content is consice and very informative.
There was some problems on he sliceY property which prevented the sprite from animating.
It might be better to split the function declaration and the example usage, so it's easier to differentiate between them.

I think the range provided for the main and running anims are also wrong, but I'm not sure as I haven't checked them yet.
